# Project Description

This project creates an app that comunucates to MeaningCloud to give feedback on the emotional perception of the text inputted by the user.

In this case the input needs to be a URL which also goes through a validation process

## Get it running

You can save a copy of the files and from your terminal:

- `cd` into evaluate-news-article or the name you gave it
- run `npm install`
- `npm build-prod` to get the compiled files

On the browser go to [here](http://localhost:8081/)

## Testing

Once you have the site running, in terminal run:
- `npm test`

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
